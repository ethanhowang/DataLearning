# DataLearning
In this repository, I will compile all the work I will be doing/studying/learning in the field of data science.
Outside of my EECS curriculum, I really had no exposure to the amazing field of data science.  
So, this summer, I will be keeping track of what I've learned of data science through this repository by adding files of the work I am/will be doing.
